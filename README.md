Help your neighbors
===

# Why
* We are facing a global crisis and we want to help people in need by enabling volunteers, helpers to connect with them fast and safely to solve issues in local communities.
* As a consequence to the covid crisis, state support systems are overburdened.
* The most endangered age group (65+) have the least digital competency and people living in poor conditions also often lack access to the internet where they could ask for help.

# What
We are creating an open-source multilingual online portal aimed at enhancing neighborhood cooperation that is scalable, promote the self-organization of local communities, ease the pressure on central/municipal social and other support systems.

## You can either:
* OFFLINE - If you see a need and can handle it yourself, you’re great! You don’t need to register the need.
* ONLINE - If you see a need on the portal, you can assign it to yourself
* ONLINE - If you see and can’t handle a need, you can register it and the platform asks others to help

# To who
Everyone in need but especially:
* Elders
* Handicapped people
* Families, single parents

# We need help in these areas

* UX/UI/Graphic designers
* Web developers
* Testers (UI automated tests would be awesome)
* Volunteers for field testing
* Volunteers for translation
* Share this project with people who could help our cause

# Why we are better than XYZ closed-source portal promoting neighbourhood cooperation?

1. We design in the special needs of a quarantine situation and also keeping volunteers motivated
2. Nextdoor in available in about 15 languages, we will crowd-source translation to as many language as needed
3. Our project is open-source and you can host is as well, so there is no single point of failure.
4. Strongest privacy guarantees: no need to give away data of your local community members to a foreign company
